    Introduction
    ------------
    
    This function uses a MIP model to optimize the number of sets in an exercise in a
    strength training program. Novices usually train with SETS x REPS, for instance
    3 x 12 - three sets of twelwe repetitions for some exercise. This is boring and does
    not allow for long-term planning.
    
    Consider a set of avaiable repetitions, {r_j}, and a set of corresponding
    intensities {i_j}. A realistic table might look like:
        
        reps          8     7      6      5      4      3
        intensities   0.7   0.74   0.78   0.82   0.86   0.90
        
    This means that this athlete can perform 6 repetitions at 78% of his/her maximum.
    From these sets we would like to draw reps and intensities to create programs, e.g.,
    
        8 x 0.7   -   6 x 0.78   -   6 x 0.78   -   5 x 0.82
        
    This corresponds to 25 repetitions and a (weighted) average intensity of
    (8 * 0.7 + 6 * 0.78 + 6 * 0.78 + 5 * 0.82) / 25 = 0.7624
    
    Mathematical model
    ------------------
    Let x_j be the number of sets performed with r_j repetitions, and a assume we have
    intensities i_j computed. We use goal programming to balance three constrains:
        
        (1) Number of reps.
            We want \sum_j x_j * r_j = reps_goal. In other words, the total number of
            reps chosen should be close to the goal. We will replace equality with slack
            variables using the goal progamming techniquer.
            
        (2) Average intensity.
            We want (\sum_j x_j * r_j * i_j) / (\sum_j x_j * r_j) = intensities_goal. 
            We rewrite to: (\sum_j x_j * r_j * i_j) = intensities_goal * (\sum_j x_j * r_j)
            Then we use slack variables and goal programming to get close.
            
        (3) Dense solutions.
            We do not want solutions such as x_8 = 2 and x_3 = 4 and every other
            component of x to be zero. The jump from 8 reps to 3 reps is too high for
            the athlete. The first measure taken to ensure this is to maximize the
            density of the solution. We define z_j as
            
                z_j = 1 if x_j >= 1, else z_j = 0
                
            Which is achieved by adding the following constraints for every j:
                
                z_j <= x_j <= M z_j
                M = upper bound on x_j
                z_j \in {0, 1} (binary integer variable)
                
            And then we add -\sum_j z_j to the minimization problem.
            
        (4) Solutions with a small range (i.e. maximum - minimum).
            With the three constrains above, solutions tend to almost always use the 
            entire range, going from .e.g 8 reps to 1 reps very often. It is not 
            desireable to use the entire range of possible repetitions in every workout.
            
            We minimize the range by defining variables `minimum` and `maximum` and 
            adding the constrains
            
                maximum >= z_j * r_j
                minimum <= z_j * r_j + (1 - z_j) * M
                M = upper bound on z_j * r_j
                
            The second constraint is interpreted as "`minimum` is smaller than z_j * r_j
            when z_j = 1 (when x_j >= 1), when z_j = 0 `minimum` is smaller than M".
            Then we add `maximum` - `minimum` to the objective, which we minimize.
            
    We use goal programming on all of these objectives, and we normalize them in a
    sensible way so a user can weight them as he pleases.
